  "title": "ABOUT ME",
  "description": "I am Aleksander, a 24 year old programmer from Sandefjord. Through my passion for video games and problem solving I discovered my compatability with coding and started my journey learning it in early 2023 and have loved it ever since. I am now learning fullstack coding, utilising tools like react, tailwind and node.js to make simpler and better websites. Through always trying to learn new solutions, taking feedback and getting others perspective and interpretations I aim to improve for every day that goes by."
